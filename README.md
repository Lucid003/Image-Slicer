# Image-Slicer
Tool to slice images into smaller images. 

Currently is hardcoded to specify a file name, but will hopefully be updated to check a directory and splice all of the files contained within.

I created this tool to split my larger game art tiles into smaller 16x16 tiles since the larger tiles weren't rendering properly with PyTMX. 

This tool takes a single input as the tile size, so inputting 16 will specify a 16x16 tile. This tool has no error detection or input verification at the moment.
