# Image-Splitter
Tool to split images into smaller images. 

User may select a single image or a folder of images. Uses EasyGUI for input and selections.

I created this tool to split my larger game art tiles into smaller 16x16 tiles since the larger tiles weren't rendering properly with PyTMX. 

This tool takes a single input as the tile size, so inputting 16 will specify a 16x16 tile. Error detection has not been implemented.
